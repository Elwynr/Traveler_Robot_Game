Traveler Robot Game
A Java-based simulation where an autonomous robot explores a grid filled with obstacles and tries to reach the target using the A* pathfinding algorithm.
Built using Java Swing for the graphical interface and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

üìã Project Overview
The Traveler Robot Game allows a robot to autonomously find its way to a goal through an obstacle-filled grid using intelligent pathfinding.
The game offers two different modes:

Problem 1:

A pre-designed grid loaded from a text file.

Three types of obstacles:

Type 1: Single cell

Type 2: 2x2 block

Type 3: 3x3 block

Start and goal points are randomly assigned.

Fog of war covers unexplored areas.

Supports step-by-step exploration or immediate shortest-path visualization.

Time and number of steps are recorded and saved to a .txt file.

Problem 2:

A randomly generated maze based on user-specified dimensions.

Only Type 1 obstacles are used to form a complex maze.

Multiple paths exist, including dead-ends.

Start and goal are placed at opposite corners.

Same exploration and result saving system as Problem 1.

The A* algorithm calculates the most efficient route, updating dynamically as the robot explores the map.
